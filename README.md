This is my first project in learning to code. Iâ€™ve been studying data science for about one month now. I started by learning Python during the first two weeks.

As practice, I exercises challange provided in class. This project is a simple cashier program with several functions:

1. Show the list of products
2. Add new products
3. Remove a product
4. Purchase product
5. Exit the program
This program is still far from perfection, so feel free to share any comments or suggestions to improve it.

Thank you very much!
